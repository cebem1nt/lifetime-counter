# Lifetime Counter

I did this project a year ago. That day I've realized that time is important and I must value it, So i came up with idea to create a web page that would count my exact age (With millisecond precision, Yes i was a bit obbsessed). Then i figured out how to set this page as my desktop background on windows. That was a very interesting project, also im a bit excited about the idea that this project, no matter what, will track my exact age forever, even when I die, so this project is my small trace :)

This project includes some background images as well, also it includes a python script to switch between images.

You can clone this repo, set your age inside of an html page and use it on your own.
